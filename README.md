# Graphs in Space (final project)

**Purpose**

  The idea of this project is to visualize graphs in 3D space and show operations that
can be done on them. Each node will be able to spawn other nodes adjacent to themself
and will have a set 'tension' on the links between them, which will represent their
desired distance from that node.
